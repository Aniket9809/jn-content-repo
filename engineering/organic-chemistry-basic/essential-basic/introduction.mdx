## Introduction
Welcome to this course of basics of organic Chemistry. You will find this course very interesting as this course has almost no mugging concepts. We will see that it is just like fourth standard mathmatics, once you master it you can solve the question in minimun time

## Organic Compounds
Earlier Scienticts belived that Organic compound are derived from living organism. They contain a vital force which is not present in non-living organism. 

## Structure of Atom
An atom consists of tiny dense nucleus surrounded by electron which occupy most of the volume. Nucleus contains positively charged protons and uncharged neutron while electrons are negetively charged. Amount of negetive charge must be equal to positive charge in an uncharged atom. so, number of protons is equal to number of electrons.

Atomic number of an atom is the number of protons in its nucleus. All elements has different atomic number.

Atomic mass is sum of proton and neutrons.

Isotopes has same atomic number while different mass number.

Atomic weight of an element is the average mass of its atoms.

For effective understanding. lets take example of carbon atom.
All carbon atom have same atomic number i.e. 6 But they do not have same mass number because they do not have same number of neutrons. For ex. 98.89% of all carbon atoms have 6 neutrons thus mass number is 12, while 1.11% have seven neutrons giving mass number 13.

Atomic weight can be calculated as average mass of its atoms including isotopes. amu (atomic mass unit) is defined as example 1/12 of the mass of <sup>12</sup>C.The atomic mass of <sup>12</sup>C is 12.0000 amu.the atomic mass of <sup>13</sup>C is 13.0034 amu. Therefore, the atomic weight of carbon is 12.011 amu (0.9889 X 12.0000)+ (0.0111 X 13.0034) =12.011.
